Kimchi Recipe 1

Two Main Steps for Making Kimchi
Baechu, or napa cabbage, kimchi is made by lacto-fermentation, the same process that creates sauerkraut and traditional dill pickles.

In the first stage, the cabbage is soaked in a salty brine that kills off harmful bacteria.
In the second stage, the remaining Lactobacillus bacteria (the good guys!) convert sugars into lactic acid, which preserves the vegetables and gives them that wonderful, tangy flavor.
If you want to learn more about fermentation, I highly recommend The Art of Fermentation by Sandor Katz.
